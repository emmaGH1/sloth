# Sloth handover

## Status

**Checkpoint 5 — deployed privately to ChatGPT Sites.** Sloth is live at `https://sloth-webmcp.theboyemma.chatgpt.site` on Sites version 1.

## Locked decisions

- Core line: **Delegate outcomes, not unlimited access.**
- Demo path: intent → investigate safe issues → request narrowly scoped refund authority for three verified duplicates → human approves/adjusts/denies → dynamically expose the scoped tool → enforce scope with structured errors → agent adapts → revoke authority at completion.
- Optimize for one flawless judge path. No auth, real payments, database, or multi-user system.
- User reports both ChatGPT Site Tools/WebMCP and WebMCP-enabled Chrome are available for later verification.

## Current test state

- Repository cloned successfully from `https://github.com/emmaGH1/sloth.git`.
- Repository had no commits or files on `main`.
- Static application created: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js`.
- The page uses `document.modelContext.registerTool` (with a legacy `navigator.modelContext` fallback) when available. Four safe tools register on page load, while the refund tool is registered only after a grant and removed with `AbortController.abort()`.
- The visual fallback mirrors the same scope-enforcement logic and produces a structured `SCOPE_VIOLATION` response.
- Scope validation is isolated in `scope.js` and covered by `node --test tests/scope.test.mjs` for the approved, unapproved, and over-limit cases.
- Verified locally: `node --check app.js`, `node --test tests/scope.test.mjs` (3 passing), whitespace diff check, and an HTTP 200 response from the local preview server.
- Published commits on `main`: `a5746a5` (controls and handover) and `2628dcc` (full demo implementation).
- Migrated the static prototype into a single-route React client app using the Sites starter runtime and `.openai/hosting.json`.
- `npm test` passes all 3 scope-enforcement tests and `npm run build` produces the required `dist/server/index.js` bundle.
- Added and verified a bespoke Sloth social-preview card with exact brand copy and host-derived Open Graph/X metadata.
- Production deployment succeeded on ChatGPT Sites and was opened in the Codex browser panel.

## Risks / open items

- Native browser testing remains required: WebMCP is a preview API and may require an enabled flag, origin trial, or browser extension. The app degrades visibly and safely if unavailable.
- Automated browser control could not load the local server because its localhost client is blocked in this environment. The local server itself returned HTTP 200; repeat browser verification directly in the user’s Chrome/ChatGPT environment.
- Native WebMCP verification on the deployed URL is still pending. The hosted page will show `WebMCP ready` when `document.modelContext` is available and `Visual fallback active` otherwise.

## NEXT ACTION

Run the README judge path at `https://sloth-webmcp.theboyemma.chatgpt.site` in WebMCP-enabled Chrome and ChatGPT Site Tools. Record the tool inventory before approval, after approval, and after revocation; fix only native-path blockers.
